Small toy project for explaining a basic guillotine based approach
for packing a set of rectangular items into a rectangular bin. Items
can be assigned costs for not packing them which have to be minimized.
They can also be assigned weights which have to be checked against
the weight capacity of the bin.

TL;DR: Toy single bin 2DRBPP with costs and weights.
